# Quantization

I have been reading and doing NN model optimization on weight quantization by clusering and weight pruing.
I have implemented some basic weight quantization. I will be adding more to this repo.

I have been using libraries like TensorFlow for quantization but I would like to know under the hood of quantization.

I might have made some mistakes. If so, please comment and share so that I can fix it and nonethless we will both get to know something amazing about
ongoing research in quantization.
